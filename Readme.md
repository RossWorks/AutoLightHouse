# Automatic Lighthouse System (ALS)
This project is an exercise to improve Arduino skills in programing a self sufficient unit.
The project is inspired to Soviet-era RTG-powered automatic lighthouses placed on northen siberian shore.
Those lighthouses were completely unattended, the ALS aims to be as controllable and programmable as possible via Bluetooth linking.
