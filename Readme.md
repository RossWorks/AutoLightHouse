# Automatic Lighthouse System (ALS)
This project is an exercise to improve Arduino skills in programing a self sufficient unit.
The project is inspired to Soviet-era RTG-powered automatic lighthouses placed on northen siberian shore.
They were fully automatic as reaching them would have been a tough challenge.
